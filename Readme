Hello sir,

The folder contains all files related to the coding assignment assigned.
No source code or any other material was used in order to complete the assignment.
In order to understand the TestInput and concvert the example into binary file the software "HXD-hex editor" was used.
The 2 input files that have been used are testexample.binimage (the example in the pdf) and the "TestInput.binimage".
The output files are MyTestExampleOutput.piximage(for example input) and MyTestOutputImage.piximage(Required output).

Compile : make

Run :
./codingassignment "Input file name" "output file name"

To my knowledge the program runs perfectly.
Please let me know if anything else needs to be done.
